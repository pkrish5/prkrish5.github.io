  <h2>Hi! My name is Pranav Krishnan</h2>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>&emsp;&emsp; Throughout my life I have enjoyed watching and playing sports, especially basketball and football, It has helped me to grow as a person because it has forced me to work as a team. Basketball has had a great impact on me my physical health as well, through my aspiration to play basketball I worked very hard in the gym to lose weight, not only losing weight but teaching me discipline and self-control. Robotics has also been a very large aspect of my life from third grade till now. Robotics also shaped me as a leader because I was tasked to lead the team to victory, even though we were kids and had many arguments, in the end we were able to work together and come to a comprimise and win.</p>
