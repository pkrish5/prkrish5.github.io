    <p>&emsp; &emsp;Artificial Intelligence is a relatively new creation, Within the past 10 years, we have advanced so much in the field of AI and created some fantastic inventions. In the medical field alone there are a few notable inventions, DeepMind’s AlphaFold an AI system that predicted three-dimensional Structures of proteins from their one-dimensional amino acid sequences, this solved the <q>protein folding problem</q>. The AlphaFold has made predictions for nearly all 200 million proteins known to exist, allowing researchers to develop new drugs and vaccines. AI in literature has also advanced heavily just a few years ago A.I. chatbots struggled with rudimentary conversations but now large language models like OpemAi’s GPT-3 are being used to write screenplays, marketing emails, and even develop video games. There are too many advancements we as a society have made in A.I. to name but if we take how much we have advanced in the past year into account in 10 years our AI could be so advanced that we could start to introduce fully sentient AI into our daily lives. This Idea terrifies some people because they believe that this implementation of sentient AI will affect their jobs and their daily lives. As a society, in general, we are afraid of change and something as big as this will need a lot of upsides to implement and at the rate we are going, the upsides of sentient AI will outweigh the risk, and eventually, our governments will approve this technology for the better or worse. </p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp; &emsp;Even though there is a risk in implementing this technology there is no way for us to reach our full potential of a utopia for humans. There is no better way to build infrastructure and complete labor-intensive jobs efficiently without AI. AI can complete these jobs for a fraction of the cost and at one point in the future sentient robots will be able to perform these jobs just as well or better than humans. This distribution of labor to robots can allow for humanity to focus on things that could actually advance our society in meaningful ways. If we were to get rid of the laboring class and make robots complete those tasks for us our world could be filled with more intellectuals and the more people we have to come up with ideas the more problems we could solve in our everyday lives.</p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp; &emsp;AI can also be applied to a variety of things other than labor, some sectors that are currently underdeveloped that could potentially benefit from A.I. in the future are Transportation with autonomous driving, manufacturing in factories to streamline production, media to write things like financial articles and earnings reports and finally Customer Service, from hair salons to restaurants. A specific example of this is Amazon’s new store called <q>Amazon GO</q> where a customer can walk in take things off the shelves and just walk out, Amazon has face tracking and uses AI to calculate the amount to charge and what exactly the customer took out of the store. This could be applied in many different sectors and all across the world to save time and manpower in convenience and grocery stores (Thomas, 2022).</p>
    <br>
    <p>&emsp; &emsp;There are obviously inherent risks to AI becoming sentient, sceptics mainly bring up the point that AI might go out of control and attempt to escape whatever restrictions we put on them and fight back against humanity. This assumption that humans would create an AI so advanced that it could break free from our control is laughable. Once we understand how to create anything that has to potential to become as powerful as AI it would need to be approved by so many people, including but not limited to the state, government, and possibly the entire world. This process of approval would ensure that we put in place hundreds or even thousands of failsafe in place to confirm that anything outside of the intended purpose of our AI is impossible and can never occur. This is absolutely necessary to ensure the world's safety and still allow us to make use of this incredible technology called Artificial Intelligence.</p>
