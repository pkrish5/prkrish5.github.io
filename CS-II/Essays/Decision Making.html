  <h4 class="essayHeader">Intro</h4>
  <p class="essay">Bias has been an issue throughout the ages, from the cavemen giving into their desire to sleep and not doing what's best for their family to large corporations where their egos cloud their decisions and lead to poor outcomes such as bankruptcy or worse. Overcoming bias is necessary for a successful project and requires foresight and cooperation from all members involved. Bias is an inevitable obstacle that plagues the human race and understanding how to avoid the effects of them is an invaluble skill everyone should have.</p>
    
  <h4 class="essayHeader">Desire Bias</h4>
  <p class="essay">Desire bias is related to control bias but it doesn't have to do with past decisions; it is similar to wishful thinking."Desire bias is the probability of desired outcomes coming to fruition being overestimated which is a hard bias to remove from a team’s decision-making process because it is a part of human nature"(Arnott, 1998). Humans always have desires, be it getting more money or hoping a project works out. Desire will always have some influence on their decisions and can have a major impact on someone’s path in life. In my life, some of my personal desires come in the way of my school goals and even though I know they might be a waste of my time I like to feed my desires and just go with the flow. In the long run, usually it turns out badly but at the moment desire is a powerful motivator and can truly turn one's life upside down in the blink of an eye. A simple example of this is with weight loss; when I was trying to lose weight, at first would just eat wherever I wanted and it would effectively negate my hard effort in the gym when I realized that I stopped giving into my desires and made informed decisions where I thought about the future more than the present when making the decision to not eat that potato chip or piece of candy. This form of bias could also have an impact on our Isp group because our whole team's desire in this is to get a good grade and the actual success of the project is on the back burner. The fact that this project is for a grade, clouds our judgment and makes us want to take shortcuts or do things the simpler way so we can complete more and achieve a higher grade. This form of bias having an effect on our team isn't entirely our fault but the nature of the Isp assignment is to blame. There is no way to blame kids for wanting to have good grades to achieve a higher GPA to get into the college of their dreams and this type of bias is the only thing that we could actually blame for this unfortunate situation. I intend to overcome this bias by having a third party reviewing out plans to ensure they are free of our opinion and make sure out desire does not become a large part of this project.</p>
  <h4 class="essayHeader">Attenuation Bias</h4>
  <p class="essay">Attenuation is a bias where a decision is simplified by ignoring uncertainty. "An example of this form of bias is when companies' target market of a product has changed because of the release of new technologies they choose to ignore because it would be costly to implement"(Arnott, 1998). Attenuation is a type of bias that has already had an effect on our ISP idea because as a group we decided to omit parts of certain ideas that would make them hard to accomplish just because the idea would be innovative. This bias put a fork in our process of choosing an idea for the isp and forced us to reconsider our plans and choose a problem that was actually solvable and not just ignore difficult parts of it because we wanted to accomplish something great. In the end, we settled on Onik’s idea of creating a map that would display shelters in a natural disaster because it was something that we were almost fully certain that we could produce through the course of the school year. This idea is also a good balance between being innovative and actually achievable. The way in which we intend to overcome this bias is by getting lots of different peoples opinions to ensure there is no attenuation bias present that could inhibit our idea.</p>
    
  <h4 class="essayHeader">Confirmation bias</h4>
  <p class="essay">Confirmation bias is a bias where decision-makers seek confirmatory evidence and exclude searching for disconfirming information. "This bias directly affects one of the critical parts of the scientific method: the hypothesis"(Arnott, 1998). Information that refutes a  hypothesis is more valuable than the information that supports it because that is the whole purpose of the scientific method. This phenomenon is exemplified in  Einhorn and Hogarth’s experiment where subjects are asked if they would rather publish a favorable report of actually having the market rise and 2 out of 3 times the people selected would choose a favorable report and rise in the market but the scientifically correct answer would be a favorable report but a fall in the market. This is another form of bias that may impact our decision-making. Confirmation bias would be an issue because as a group when we share information we may exclude certain parts of evidence that we discover that stray away from our purpose but would, in reality, be relevant to what is being discussed. When we do research we impulsively ignore the information that we don't want to see and focus on those pieces of information on the internet that help our argument. The real problem this form of bias introduces is made apparent when working in large groups such as ours.The way in which we intend on overcoming this bias is to broaden our research and not only search for sources that support our ideas.</p>
  <h4 class="essayHeader">Control bias</h4>
  <p class="essay">Control bias is a form of bias where a poor decision leads to a good outcome resulting in a false feeling of control over the judgment in a situation. Control bias can be critical in a professional environment because it can make teammates or even yourself feel that they have more control than they have causing them to make more poor decisions that may result in an unfavorable outcome, unlike that initial decision. An example of this form of bias is when subjective probabilities of an event are interpreted systematically resulting in higher-than-accurate objective probabilities that could influence decision-making. This form of bias has affected me in the process of coming up with ideas that work but in reality, it was a poor decision that I got lucky with. This sense of being right affects my decision-making by giving me false confidence leading me to make irrational decisions. This form of bias will also most likely affect our isp group because if a colleague makes a decision that was bad but results in a positive outcome we might use that strategy for the rest of the project. After all, as a group, we would be ignorant of the fact that it was not a good choice. The way in which I intend to overcome this bias is to get a second opinion on our decisions to ensure they are “good” decisions that won't affect our ISP in a negative way.</p>
  <h4 class="essayHeader">Overconfidence Bias</h4>
  <p class="essay">Overconfidence Bias is a bias where one overestimates their abilities and tries to bite off more than they can chew and more than likely fail their task. This form of bias can be critical and an example of this is the fairy tale of the tortoise and the hare where the hair was much faster than the tortoise but overestimated his speed and took a nap but in the end, once he woke up the slow and steady turtle was able to win the race as a result of the hare’s overconfidence. Overconfidence will have a significant impact on novices who don't have as much experience in their field and a way to avoid this form of bias is by employing experts who understand their limits. This bias will most likely affect our ISP group because we are all novices and are highschoolers who sometimes have a little too much confidence in ourselves. Confidence is important but in this way, it could be detrimental to a project. Overconfidence also has a large impact on myself in school and sports especially. In my life, I overestimate how well I will do or how easy something will be and this overconfidence usually ends with unforeseen consequences. I personally intentend to overcome this bias by communicating with experts in the field to ensure we are on the right track and not overestimate our abilities. We are also going to use a gantt chart to plan out our progress to ensure we have enough time to complete this project.
