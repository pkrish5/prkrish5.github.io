    <p class="smallText">&emsp;&emsp;Last week we didnt make much progress as a team due to AP exams starting and this week we have ap exams so I am just trying to crate a page to change shelters, i am somewhat finished with it but it isnt done. Coupled with the extensive missions we have due I dont expect much progress this week. I hope to be able to finish the shelter page this week and hopefuly get the qa team to test it.</p>
    <h3 class="generalText">What I actually did</h3>
    <p class="smallText">I was able to mock up 2 of the pages, im awaiting QA Aprroval so i can implement them on the final project. We have mutliple teams working on this shelter page so im not sure if my changes will be neccicary but they are on my brand pranavCommits nonetheless. There were a lot of technical issues I faced regarding implementation of this page into our app, im getting help with that right now but that should be a part of next weeks final touches.</p>

    <h3 class="generalText">Testing</h3>
    <p class="generalText">I havent started testing the page but I have contacted QA and they are going to get on it as soon as possible with the deadline fast approaching</p>

    <p class="smallText">This mock test page is just a page in which shelters can be created by admins, Admin login is part of another teams tasks but essencially whats happening is the admin bool is true we will allow access to this page that can directy update the shelter class and created shelters on the map for view</p>

<h3 class="generalText">Roles:</h4>
<h3 class="generalText">(Software) Development Engineer</h3>
<p class="smallText">&emsp;&emsp;A software development engineer is a software engineer who is in charge of creating a particular software system or product. This could entail working with a group of other software engineers and developers to guarantee the product is created quickly and effectively, as well as designing, coding, testing, and debugging software. I would be a somewhat suitable member for this role but there are other teammates I have on our team that are more efficient and would create a better final product than I could as a Software Engineer.</p>
<h3 class="generalText">QA Engineer</h3>
<p class="smallText">&emsp;&emsp;A QA engineer, or quality assurance engineer, is responsible for testing and ensuring that a software product is of an exceptional quality and meets with the guidelines and criteria provided by the client and the development team. This could require designing and running test cases, as well as analyzing and presenting the outcomes of those tests. I would be quite suitable for this role because in my personal projects i ensure they are to the highest quality so this role would align with my values and how I work on projects.</p>
<h3 class="generalText">Project Manager</h3>
<p class="smallText">&emsp;&emsp;A project manager is in charge of organizing, directing, and planning the creation of a particular software project. This could involve identifying the projects goals and objectives with a team of developers and other stakeholders, developing a project plan, and making sure the project and its members stay on track and the projects stays within the budget.I believe I would also be suitable for this role because I have experience in leading projects and managing people and I find that as something I could do efficiently and at a high level.</p>
<h3 class="generalText">Product Manager</h3>
<p class="smallText">&emsp;&emsp;A product manager is responsible for identifying and pushing the strategy and vision for a specific product or product line. This could entail gathering and analyzing customer input, performing market research, and collaborating with a group of developers to define and rank features and functionalities. I believe I would not be suitable for this role because I have no prior experience in gathering and analyzing customer research or performing research so I dont think I would be a good fit for this role.
</p>
<h3 class="generalText">Release Engineer</h3>
<p class="smallText">&emsp;&emsp;A release engineer is in charge of coordinating and managing the release of software applications to production environments. This could entail establishing and maintaining release processes and procedures, collaborating with other teams to plan and carry out the release, and working with development and QA teams to make sure the program is prepared for release. I would be a good fit for this role because I am good at communicating with people and working with others internally to guarantee a smooth and successful release</p>
